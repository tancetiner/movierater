# movierater

This is a web application I’m developing as a side project right now. 
I’m using ReactJS for frontend and Python Django for backend. 
Main functionality of the application is to get random movie recommendations on the home page. User can view the info about the movie and either add the movie to their watchlist or if they already watched the movie they can rate it. 
User can look at the watchlist and the ratings they gave before.  This will be possible with their accounts.

I’ll be updating here as the project progresses…
